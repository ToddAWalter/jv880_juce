# VirtualJV

Emulator of a famous 1U rack unit rompler made by Roland in 1992, as a VST3 and AU plugin. Based on [NukeYKT's SC55](https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-SC55).

You'll need ROMs to use this software. During the first run you will be able to open the destination ROM folder. Copy your ROMs there, restart the plugin, and wait for a minute for the first load to happen (waveform ROMs need to be descrambled and copied to a cache, which may take a minute). Have fun!
